## Game Overview

**Pawmancer** is a turn-based card game where players battle as fantasy dog heroes, summoning dog cards, casting spells, and equipping items to defeat their opponent. The game features a unique "treats" resource system (similar to mana in other card games) and strategic combat mechanics.

### Core Concept

- Players start at the **Start Screen** (entry point with branding and navigation)
- Navigate to **Hero Selection** (choose from 3 heroes, each with unique abilities and health)
- Build a deck from a shared card library
- Battle against an AI opponent
- Reduce opponent's health to zero to win

### Onboarding Flow

1. **Start Screen** → Entry point with "Start Game" and "Rules/Tutorial" buttons
2. **Hero Selection** → Choose from 3 heroes (Rex, Buddy, Shadow)
3. **Game Screen** → Battle against AI opponent
4. **Tutorial System** → Optional tutorial modal and first-time tooltips guide new players

---

#### 7. Reduce Hero Roster to 3 Heroes (High Priority) ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Purpose:** Simplify hero selection for cleaner starter experience in early development.

**Dependencies:** None

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Trimmed playable heroes:** `HEROES` data now contains only Rex, Buddy, and Shadow so both player choice and enemy selection draw from the same focused trio.

- [x] **Hero Select layout:** Screen now centers three hero cards with even spacing for a balanced presentation on all breakpoints.

---

---

#### 10. Combat Board UX Overhaul (High Priority)

**Purpose:** Address the new layout critique by tightening the battlefield, clarifying available actions, and reinforcing the playful Pawmancer theme.

**Dependencies:** Hero roster and selection refresh (Tasks 7-9) so the combat screen can take center stage.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Compress battlefield layout:** Game screen now uses a three-column layout with a slimmed header, clustered hero/treat modules, and tighter spacing between enemy/player lanes.
  - Header bar trimmed to a tighter `py-2` padding and darker strip, keeping turn text + tutorial affordances visible without consuming vertical space.
  - Enemy and player rows now sit inside a shared column container with a modest gap (`gap-y-4`), minimizing the dead band between halves and keeping the 'Your Dogs' label from creating extra whitespace.
  - New `HeroPanel` clusters hero portrait, health, treats, and (for the player) hero power using `flex items-center gap-3`, eliminating stray counters and ensuring the info always travels with each hero banner.
- [x] **Clarify hierarchy:** Make hero health/treat counters larger, consolidate “Turn/Your Turn/message” into one celebratory banner, and move End Turn / Attack Enemy into a dedicated control corner.
- [x] **Interaction feedback:** Add attack arrows and target highlights, bake costs/readiness into the hero power button, and provide drag/hover affordances for playable cards.
  - **Targeting Arrow:** Implemented `TargetingArrow.tsx` as an SVG overlay connecting the selected attacker to the mouse cursor with a quadratic Bezier curve.
  - **Target Highlights:** Valid targets now glow red (`ring-4 ring-red-500`) with a crosshair cursor when an attacker is selected.
  - **Hero Power Button:** Added visual readiness state; button pulses and glows purple when the player has enough treats and the ability is unused.
  - **Card Affordances:** Added "lift" hover effects (`hover:-translate-y-2`) and shadow depth to cards in hand to indicate interactivity.
- [x] **Visual theming:** Replace flat bands with pawprint or bone patterns, add subtle props near hero zones, and apply gradients that distinguish enemy vs. player halves.
  - **Backgrounds:** Implemented `BackgroundPatterns.tsx` with SVG Bone (Enemy) and PawPrint (Player) patterns.
  - **Gradients:** Applied deep Crimson/Purple for Enemy and Teal/Navy for Player zones.
  - **Props:** Added decorative SVG elements to the enemy zone.
- [ ] **Microinteractions & effects:** Implement hover/ready glows, attack-ready pulses, turn-start banners, and thematic particles for abilities (scratches, sparkles, summon dust).
